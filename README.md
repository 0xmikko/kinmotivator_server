## Customer journey 
Lets meet our personals. George and he is runner and he manage his own running club. Loom is a guy who wants to loose weight (he weights more than 100kg).

Loom installs the app and found community which is managed by George and started to go for jogging in George sport club. They do jogging together 2 times a week, but all team members are agreed to jog every day. It's called "homework".

When each team member does homework (some sports activities), he or she publishes a post with photo and small description. They could motivate each other by sending Kins with small comments.

George as a trainee, helps newcomers to keep track, he sends 10 Kins to Loom to motivate him and add some warm words. Each time when Loom make a small step to his goal, he publishes his achievements and other community members could see it and support by sending Kin.

When Loom established good jogging habit and achieve something, he also decided to help others. He asked his friend to join their club and also advices him to use KinMotivator for keeping track.
